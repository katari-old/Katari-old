<body>
This package contains the application layer objects for the time entry module.
<br>

The application layer defines the jobs the software is supposed to do and
directs the expressive domain objects to work out problems. The tasks this
layer is responsible for are meaningful to the business or necessary for
interaction with the application layers of other systems.
<br>

This layer is kept thin. It does not contain business rules or knowledge, but
only coordinates tasks and delegates work to collaborations of domain
objects in the next layer down. It does not have state reflecting the business
situation, but it can have state that reflects the progress of a task for the
user or the program.
<br>

Transactions are demarcated in this layer.
