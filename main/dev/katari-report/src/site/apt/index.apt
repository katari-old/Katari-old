Reports design

 The report module for Katari allows the user to build and execute reports.
 The report is built using a visual tool and then uploaded into Katari, to
 be executed from a web interface on a later date.

 The reports may be generated using the WYSIWYG tool iReports, where the
 designer can customise the look and feel of the report. The query to generate
 the report is written using SQL language inside iReports.

 The report file is uploaded into Katari using a web interface. The user is
 prompted to map the types used in the report parameters, so they can be
 displayed correctly in a web form.

 At a later time, a user with the correct role (specified upon the report
 creation) can execute the report and print the output into a PDF.

Using this module

 To include this module in a Katari based application, simply put a line of the
 form:

------
<katari:import module="com.globant.katari.report"/>

Design

* Domain model

[images/report-module-domain.png]

* Entities responsibilities

 [ReportDefinition] The report definition represents the blueprint of a report,
 with the intended layout, query and constraints. The actual contents of the
 report are opaque to the programmer, who only knows the relevant parts of the
 report. The report definition also specifies which roles can execute it.

 [ParameterDefinition] The parameter definition is the description of a
 variable constraint in the report. The constraint is created in definition
 time, and will be mapped for example to a constraint in the WHERE clause of
 a SQL statement. In runtime, the actual value of the parameter is specified,
 and the report is run with the appropriate constraint.

 [Role] The roles that can execute a report, and are taken from the DB.

 [JasperReportGenerator] The Jasper generator is used to execute a report
 definition which was designed used iReports. The execution will need an actual
 report definition, and the actual values for the parameters specified by such
 definition. The output of the generator will depend on the ReportType, and
 will be a PDF, an HTML, etc.

Use case scenarios

* Report upload

 [[1]] The User creates a report using Jasper iReports WYSIWYG tool

 [[1]] The User selects 'new report', fills in the information, selects the
 file he has just created for upload and submits the form.

 [[1]] The System creates the Report Definition and uploads it to the database.

* Report execution

 [[1]] The User selects a report previously uploaded.

 [[1]] The System shows a screen with the defined parameters for the selected
 report, and propts the user to complete them.

 [[1]] The User completes the report parameters by which the final report will
 be filtered and submits the form.

 [[1]] The System retrieves the report definition from the database.

 [[1]] The System generates the report according to the definition and the
 actual parameters given by the User.

 [[1]] The System prompts the User to download the generated report.
