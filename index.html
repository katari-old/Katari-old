        <h3>Welcome to Katari</h3>
          <p>
            Katari is a powerful open source development platform, created by Globant, for building rich Internet applications in Java. Katari integrates technologies such as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), Spring framework (IOC, MVC, Transaction) and Java Persistence API (Hibernate) into a unified full-stack solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            But you don't have to spend a week or more properly integrating and configuring them. With Katari you get a sample application up and running in a couple of minutes. This sample application includes:
            <ul>
              <li>Secured and non-secured content. A login page allows you to access secured content.</li>
              <li>A nice styled site, where all styling element are under your control.</li>
              <li>A security aware menu structure.</li>
              <li>Sample pages that can be edited on line with the help of FCKEditor.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <div>When you start a project with Katari you will also find a strong reliance on best practices:</div>
              <ul>

                <li>You will find testing (unit and integration) already in place, with a nice approach to integrating tests that hits the database.</li>
                <li>Katari modular approach will make it easier to develop guided by business driven requirements.</li>
                <li>You can get started in Katari with the help of the provided maven archetype (yes, it uses maven). The getting started guide will give you instructions on how to start with Katari.</li>
              </ul>
